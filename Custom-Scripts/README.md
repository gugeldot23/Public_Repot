HI!

This folder organsises all important updates I did to this scripts I made. 

This are, as their name indicate, some shell scripts I made to get my life easier in 
some way (In order this to make sense, I have to indicate I'm currently using Arch linux 
with Awesome wm, so therefore some programs such as Bluetooth or wifi aren't as easy 
to access as other desktop enviroments. 

Anyways, I hope this scripts help you in some way or bring you with new ideas. 

Have a good day!

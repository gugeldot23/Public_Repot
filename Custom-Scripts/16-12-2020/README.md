Hi there!, 

Today I've modified the script I use for automating compiling the scripts and putinig it
into the /bin folder. 

I had to mostly modify the code to make it simpler, easier to understand an to modify. 
I added a --help and single file compilation (--just). 

I hope you find it interesting or even use it if you like.

Have a great day!

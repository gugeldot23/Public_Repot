Hi!
This new version its a revison of my new scripts
I got the Idea of making them as simple and straight forward asap. 
So thats what I did with WilfiManager -> wiiTurbo now, Blight_Terminal -> blighty now , and 
Fusioned FreeSpaceScript and BatteryCheck -> Turbostate. 
I put in a folder the ones I didn't moded because 2 reasons, 1.Their good as it is 
(xranscreen) or 2. I think they're better with a menu (Toothy-Manager)

This are scripts one command line much more simpler and lighter in code lines compared to 
the others.
I hope you like it. 
PD: I will say this is 04/07/2020 even though it's not so it's simpler to organsie. 
Have fun!
